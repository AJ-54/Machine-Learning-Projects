Some tips and tricks that can be of great help when studying and working with a machine learning dataset â€“  Have a clear and in-depth understanding of the problem that the dataset represents. Always summarize the machine learning dataset using descriptive statistics. Make a note of the structures you observe in the data and put forward all the relationships  observed in the data. Quickly test a couple of top machine learning algorithms on the dataset and find out which general class of algorithms has a better performance. Tune the algorithms to identify the algorithm that performs well for a given data problem and tune it accordingly.
