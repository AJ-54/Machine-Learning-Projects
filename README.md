Some tips and tricks that can be of great help when studying and working with a machine learning dataset â€“  
1) Have a clear and in-depth understanding of the problem that the dataset represents. 
2) Always summarize the machine learning dataset using descriptive statistics. 
3) Make a note of the structures you observe in the data and put forward all the relationships  observed in the data. 
4) Quickly test a couple of top machine learning algorithms on the dataset and find out which general class of algorithms has a better        performance. 
5) Tune the algorithms to identify the algorithm that performs well for a given data problem and tune it accordingly.
