# Implementing Tensorflow 



The problem we will solve is to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit, where the approximate formula is:

f=c√ó1.8+32 
Of course, it would be simple enough to create a conventional Python function that directly performs this calculation, but that wouldn't be machine learning.

Instead, we will give TensorFlow some sample Celsius values (0, 8, 15, 22, 38) and their corresponding Fahrenheit values (32, 46, 59, 72, 100). Then, we will train a model that figures out the above formula through the training process.
